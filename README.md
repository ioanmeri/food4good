# food4good

## A simple front end project for an imaginary start up business.

### Goal of this project was to familiarize and implement basic JS and CSS techniques. The fluid grid is quite old, although it can be used to solve backward compatibility issues (a few browsers don't support flexbox).
### food4good covers:

* Colors, Typography, Icons and Layout
* Fluid grid for responsive web design
* Media queries
* FavIcon (that's why there are many icons in the root folder)
* jQuery: "sticky" navigation and animations
* Performance optimization (except css minify)
* Basic search engine optimization
* Google Maps
* PHP for the form submit (althought web hosting is necessary to work)
